Upon launching Story Tell you are brought to your *Bookshelf*, which contains some instructions as well as all the titles that have been written on your device. Pick a title to read by pressing on it.

Story Tell features a *Reader* that has a "Peek Ahead" function when you long press on a story option at the bottom of the page.

You can also turn on "Night Mode" to ease eye strain during nighttime reading (or if you need a high contrast mode to suit your vision needs) by pressing the gear on the upper-right hand page of the Reader, then pressing the switch labeled "Night Mode."

To edit text, tap on it twice. When finished editing, press the button that appears in the upper right hand button that looks like an editing pencil.

**Story Tell is still being developed. Please check back soon for more features and eventual push to the Apple App Store!**
